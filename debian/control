Description: Perform end-user configuration after initial installation
 The oem-config script re-asks a number of questions that are normally asked
 during installation, and reconfigures the system accordingly. This allows a
 vendor to install a skeleton system, clone it onto a large number of
 machines, and ship it to end users, while still allowing end users to set
 up their own username and password, language, timezone, and so on.
