oem-config (1.3) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Import subprocess in console-setup component (closes: Malone #60409).
  * Fix language name handling (closes: Malone #60410).
  * GTK frontend: Make the Forward button the default widget so that it's
    activated when Enter is pressed.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: console-setup 1.7ubuntu9.

oem-config (1.2) edgy; urgency=low

  * Merge from ubiquity:
    - Move from kbd-chooser to console-setup
      (https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/sane-installer-keyboard).
      We still need to add a UI element for the keyboard variant, and
      translations of layout and variant names are missing, but it mostly
      seems to work.
    - Strip Fonts and Keyboard directories from our copy of console-setup;
      they're very large, and not needed since we don't actually build
      console-setup, but just copy a few scripts from it.

oem-config (1.1) edgy; urgency=low

  * Merge KDE frontend from Anirudh Ramesh.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: kbd-chooser 1.30ubuntu1,
    localechooser 1.20ubuntu6, tzsetup 1:0.10ubuntu2, user-setup 1.2ubuntu3.

oem-config (1.0) edgy; urgency=low

  * Reorganise oem-config to have a reasonable frontend/backend separation,
    thereby allowing for a future KDE port. This involved updating much of
    the core to look more like ubiquity (since ubiquity's core was an
    evolution of oem-config's), and a new UI using a single window/notebook
    rather than a succession of dialogs.
  * Casualties of this work include the whole base-config-like menu
    structure and the include/exclude mechanism. The menu structure made it
    difficult to avoid spawning a new dialog for each step, which was a poor
    UI; I don't believe the include/exclude mechanism was heavily used, but
    contact me if you were relying on it and it may be possible to restore
    it in a new form.
  * I haven't yet ported the new i18n infrastructure from ubiquity, so the
    oem-config UI will be untranslated.
  * Like ubiquity, we now incorporate source for all d-i components we use
    under d-i/source/ and include them directly in our binary package,
    reducing the number of complex interdependencies with d-i packages.
    'debian/rules update' can be used to do automatic updates of these
    copied source packages.
  * Remove some leftover code that dealt with restoring the inittab, as we
    don't do the temporary inittab thing any more.
  * Fix kbd-chooser wrapper script to actually install the selected keymap
    (though only for the console at present).
  * Move from prebaseconfig to finish-install.
  * Make oem-config Architecture: any, since it now includes kbd-chooser
    binaries.
  * Add an oem-config-gtk package for the GTK frontend.
  * Convert to python-support.
  * Fix apt-install compatibility wrapper to use debconf's noninteractive
    frontend, tell debconf not to send e-mail, avoid upgrading, ignore GPG
    time conflicts, and suppress prompts.
  * Update localechooser wrapper to handle /etc/default/locale (based on
    localechooser 0.19) and to use /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED (based on
    localechooser 1.20ubuntu5).
  * Make more of an effort to display translated country names.
  * Use /bin/bash for user-setup due to a dash test(1) bug.
  * Language names are now sorted according to the local name for each
    language (closes: Malone #47724).

oem-config (0.14) dapper; urgency=low

  * Set LANGUAGE as well as LANG when changing the locale; this allows us to
    get correct debconf translations without needing to run locale-gen (see
    Malone #43071).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 12 May 2006 15:27:07 +0100

oem-config (0.13) dapper; urgency=low

  * Depend on xserver-xorg and metacity for oem-config-dm (closes: Malone
    #33837).
  * Depend on user-setup for username/password menu item (closes: Malone
    #33277).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 13 Apr 2006 14:13:41 +0100

oem-config (0.12) dapper; urgency=low

  * Make better use of dh_install.
  * Add various helpers in /usr/lib/oem-config/compat, moved here from
    oem-config-locale.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 17 Jan 2006 15:33:33 +0000

oem-config (0.11) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add a main-menu step to the udeb which is responsible for arranging to
    create the oem user with a suitable uid. This was formerly done by a
    preseed file.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 16 Jan 2006 18:38:37 +0000

oem-config (0.10) dapper; urgency=low

  * Remove unused moduledir variable.
  * Remove passwd menu entry, now moved to user-setup.
  * Build binary package in binary-indep, not binary-arch.
  * We now use a single-stage installer, so we can no longer hook into
    base-config. Add a udeb instead which provides instructions on what to
    do after the first boot, and add an oem-config-prepare program which
    should be run by the OEM once they have completed any necessary
    modifications. Note that this means that the system is no longer
    prepared for the end-user until oem-config-prepare is manually run
    (closes: Malone #28095).
  * Make oem-config-udeb responsible for installing oem-config in /target.
    This will require preseed file changes.
  * Remove timezone menu entry, now moved to oem-config-timezone.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 16 Jan 2006 16:20:14 +0000

oem-config (0.9) breezy; urgency=low

  * Quieten output from deluser.
  * Quieten output from debconf-communicate while resetting passwd/user-uid.
  * Try setting LANG to the value of debian-installer/fallbacklocale if the
    value of debian-installer/locale isn't a valid locale (Ubuntu #17366).
  * Set labels in passwd and timezone windows to the translated descriptions
    of the same questions in the installer; sync text of passwd labels with
    the text in passwd.templates (Ubuntu #17366).
  * Re-register passwd/user-fullname and passwd/username templates to
    themselves rather than debian-installer/dummy (although it's a bug
    somewhere in preseeding that they're left this way) so that we get
    useful translated descriptions for them.
  * Set title of timezone window to the translated description of
    tzconfig/title. Unfortunately this is too hard to do for the passwd
    window at present.
  * Exiting oem-config can leave you without a configured user, so try not
    to exit unnecessarily. If we have to, then print an error message with
    instructions and drop the user to a shell, since that's better than a
    login prompt with no users.
  * Reload /var/lib/dpkg/info/base-config.templates for timezone question;
    for some reason the translations seem to be getting lost from it.

oem-config (0.8) breezy; urgency=low

  * Remove the temporary OEM configuration user before running oem-config.
  * Reset passwd/user-uid before running oem-config, so that the new user is
    created at uid 1000 rather than 29999.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon,  3 Oct 2005 13:04:42 +0100

oem-config (0.7) breezy; urgency=low

  * Use an init script and temporary rc.d links to launch
    oem-config-firstboot on the first boot after installation, rather than a
    temporary inittab. The latter approach caused base-config to be
    respawned after exiting.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 21 Sep 2005 12:53:13 +0100

oem-config (0.6) breezy; urgency=low

  * Set passwd and timezone window gravity to center.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 14 Sep 2005 13:35:58 +0100

oem-config (0.5) breezy; urgency=low

  * Unset LANGUAGE while running steps; it overrides LANG and thereby causes
    much confusion.
  * Policy version 3.6.2. No changes required.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue,  9 Aug 2005 16:48:08 +0100

oem-config (0.4) breezy; urgency=low

  * Emit a debug message when changing LANG.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue,  9 Aug 2005 16:31:07 +0100

oem-config (0.3) breezy; urgency=low

  * Actually install /usr/sbin/oem-config-firstboot.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed,  3 Aug 2005 20:18:53 +0100

oem-config (0.2) breezy; urgency=low

  * Update GPL notices with the FSF's new address.
  * Add description for base-config menu entry.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed,  3 Aug 2005 11:59:44 +0100

oem-config (0.1) breezy; urgency=low

  * Initial release.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 29 Jul 2005 17:24:44 +0100
