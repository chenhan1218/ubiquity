espresso (0.99.1) dapper; urgency=low

  * Rename to espresso to avoid confusion caused by somebody other than
    Ubuntu being upstream for a project called "Ubuntu ...", to reduce
    awkward branding considerations, and to clearly separate the work being
    done on this project for Dapper from the work done by Guadalinex since
    the focus is rather different.
  * Change Maintainer to me.
  * Rename lib directory in source to espresso so that pychecker can be used
    more easily.
  * Log to /var/log/installer/espresso instead of /var/log/<distro>-express.
  * Change all uses of express/* debconf questions to real questions where
    possible, and espresso/* where not.

  * Add debconffilter.py from oem-config (this has been sent to debconf
    upstream and may eventually make it in there instead). We'll use this
    for d-i integration.
  * Adjust debconffilter to filter out STOP.
  * Add generic error question handling, METAGET filtering, SUBST filtering,
    and PROGRESS filtering to debconffilter.
  * Ignore unknown commands in debconffilter, since some programs (hi,
    partman!) use multi-line commands despite them only working in cdebconf
    by fluke.
  * Add debconfcommunicator.py too; it's been committed to debconf upstream,
    but it's useful here anyway for backports to breezy.
  * Add rudimentary FilteredCommand class, a convenience wrapper around
    DebconfFilter that makes it easier to test various things.
  * Add filtered debconf progress bar handling in the GTK frontend.

  * Add apt-install and udpkg compatibility shims.
  * Call user-setup as a debconffilter coprocess while running the
    corresponding UI step, replacing our own duplicated validation code.
  * Call partman as a debconffilter coprocess while running the
    autopartitioning UI step. Remove peez2 entirely, as this will replace it
    once it's finished.
  * Change gparted invocation to use new --installer=WID option.
  * Replace hand-rolled partition formatting and mounting code with a call
    to PartmanCommit.
  * Copy from /rofs if it exists, rather than hunting through the CD for the
    filesystem image. Requires casper 1.25.
  * Run hook scripts in /usr/lib/espresso/target-config (filenames
    containing '.' are ignored) so that casper can propagate appropriate
    parts of its configuration to the target system.
  * Remove all references to base-config; timezone configuration now
    requires a .deb of the new tzsetup.
  * Use espresso-grub for GRUB installation rather than doing it by hand.
  * Drop dependency on yaboot | grub.

  * Refer to ubuntu.com everywhere, not the deprecated ubuntulinux.org.
  * Don't use full-screen mode.
  * Don't keep the GTK user interface window on top; it's annoying during
    development, and arguable at best in production.
  * Remove the numbers from the breadcrumb trail at the top of the screen.
  * Disable embedded web browser for now since this segfaults in current
    dapper (Bugzilla #20338). For the time being, replace it with a scary
    message telling users to be sure to BACK UP THEIR DATA FIRST.
  * Translate strings in glade file and progress queue messages to English.
    In the unlikely event that any of the strings remain basically
    identical, I'll restore the original text as a Spanish translation.
  * In general, don't send a progress queue message when completing a task,
    only when starting one. There's no point constructing translatable text
    that's only going to be on the screen for tiny fractions of a second
    anyway.
  * Strip newlines from lines in messages.txt.
  * Get rid of almost-useless help button. In general, the UI should be made
    self-explanatory rather than requiring extra clicks to get at help
    information.

  * Fix Config.get_locales() using DebconfCommunicator.
  * Try fetching timezone from /etc/localtime as well as from /etc/timezone.
  * Handle missing keymap and/or locale debconf questions.
  * Fix kernel version detection.
  * Use 'lsb_release -is' rather than reading /etc/lsb-release directly.
  * Depend on lsb-release.
  * Don't preselect a mount point for /home.
  * Fix unmounting at end of installation.
  * Remove ubuntu-express wrapper script; eventually we'll do whatever
    unmounting is necessary during the partitioning step rather than turning
    off swap for the whole installer (and partman should help with this
    already).
  * Install installer script as /usr/bin/espresso rather than
    /usr/bin/installer.
  * Quieten cpio a bit.

  * Use dh_installdocs to install documentation.
  * Remove unnecessary ${shlibs:Depends} dependencies.
  * Fix broken use of debhelper; the author seemed to be confusing -A and
    -a, and in any case we only build architecture-independent packages.
  * Use dh_install instead of verbose code in debian/rules (which includes a
    bashism anyway).
  * Remove hardcoded svn commands in generate-doc.sh.
  * Remove svn exclusion stuff in debian/rules; if building from a
    Subversion checkout, you should use standard workarounds to avoid .svn
    directories.
  * Remove generated source code documentation for now; it's really not
    terribly useful, certainly not in the espresso binary package, and
    ultimately it should be generated as part of the build process if at
    all.
  * Rewrite descriptions to be better English and (I hope) more useful.
