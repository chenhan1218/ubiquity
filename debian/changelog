espresso (0.99-1ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Rename to espresso to avoid confusion caused by somebody other than
    Ubuntu being upstream for a project called "Ubuntu ...", to reduce
    awkward branding considerations, and to clearly separate the work being
    done on this project for Dapper from the work done by Guadalinex since
    the focus is rather different.
  * Rename lib directory in source to espresso so that pychecker can be used
    more easily.
  * Use dh_installdocs to install documentation.
  * Remove unnecessary ${shlibs:Depends} dependencies.
  * Add debconffilter.py from oem-config (this has been sent to debconf
    upstream and may eventually make it in there instead). We'll use this
    for d-i integration.
  * Adjust debconffilter to filter out STOP.
  * Add generic error question handling to debconffilter.
  * Add debconfcommunicator.py too; it's been committed to debconf upstream,
    but it's useful here anyway for backports to breezy.
  * Refer to ubuntu.com everywhere, not the deprecated ubuntulinux.org.
  * Add archdetect compatibility shim, since lots of d-i programs need it.
  * Add apt-install compatibility shim.
  * Add rudimentary FilteredCommand class, a convenience wrapper around
    DebconfFilter that makes it easier to test various things.
  * Fix broken use of debhelper; the author seemed to be confusing -A and
    -a, and in any case we only build architecture-independent packages.
  * Don't use full-screen mode.
  * Use 'lsb_release -is' rather than reading /etc/lsb-release directly.
  * Depend on lsb-release.
  * Drop dependency on peez2. We don't have anything to replace it with yet
    (although we will), but depending on a nonexistent package makes
    development work too awkward.
  * Disable embedded web browser for now since this segfaults in current
    dapper (Bugzilla #20338).
  * Fix Config.get_locales() using DebconfCommunicator.
  * Call user-setup as a debconffilter coprocess while running the
    corresponding UI step, replacing our own duplicated validation code.
  * Use dh_install instead of verbose code in debian/rules (which includes a
    bashism anyway).
  * Remove hardcoded svn commands in generate-doc.sh.
