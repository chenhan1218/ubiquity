This directory contains code cut-and-pasted from evolution via
gnome-system-tools, all for a map widget. Sigh. Where possible, please don't
modify code in this directory except to update it to the latest version from
gnome-system-tools (or another suitable project).

gdm-signal is imported from powermanagement-interface, pending proper
interfaces in gdm/gnome-session for this kind of thing.
