This testcase works for Ubuntu, Xubuntu and Lubuntu.

But until support for setup and tear down has been implemented
the test needs modifying for Xubuntu and Lubuntu

To make these edits go into test_default.py and in the test_default_install method change

    self.keyboard.press_and_release('Super+1')

    To

    #self.keyboard.press_and_release('Super+1')

For the test to run we need have these installed:
  
    sudo apt-get install python-autopilot libautopilot-gtk python-xlib

python-xlib is needed for the x11 backend to work. universe repo needs activating in sources

Once installed copy ubiquity & ubiquity-wrapper files to the right place

  sudo cp ./ubuntu_autopilot_tests/ubiquity/bin/ubiquity-wrapper /usr/bin/ubiquity
  sudo cp ./ubuntu_autopilot_tests/ubiquity/bin/ubiquity /usr/lib/ubiquity/bin/ubiquity

In one terminal
* Execute ./run_ubiquity to start ubiquity in "autopilot" mode

Wait for ubiquity to start up then in another terminal window
* Execute ./autopilot as if it's `autopilot`, e.g.:
  ./autopilot list ubiquity
  ./autopilot run ubiquity

NOTE: If running on Xubuntu or Lubuntu make sure that your terminal windows are not covering
the ubiquity continue button before you run ./autopilot run ubiquity.
